1. logs are not going anywhere! we should create a centralized service to manage and monitor and store logs
2. I didn't create a connection pool for database connection, for this usecase creating new connection each time should be ok!
3. This setup is only good for testing and development. for deployment we need either serverless or kubernetes
4. All routes should be in routes/ folder
